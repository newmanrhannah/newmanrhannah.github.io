<h1>Project Pitches!</h1>

<h2>Pitch 1: A close up on Bikram Yoga</h2>

Yoga is growing in popularity and hype. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine <a href= "http://nccam.nih.gov/health/yoga/introduction.htm">(NCCAM)</a>, over 13 million adults regularly practice. One of the most popular types is hot yoga. <br>
<br>
Bikram yoga, practiced in a 105-degree room, consists of a strict routine of 26 postures in 90 minutes. The claim is that these postures &ldquo;systematically work every part of the body, to give all the internal organs, all the veins, all the ligaments, and all the muscles everything they need to maintain optimum health and maximum function.&rdquo; I&#39;d like to examine if that&#39;s true. <br>
<br>
I&#39;d do this by analyzing the practice using a compilation from at least <a href= "http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/finder/anatomical_focus">these</a> <a href= "http://www.bikramyoga.com/BikramYoga/TwentySixPostures.php">two</a> sources (if not these <a href= "http://www.bikramyogacapalaba.com.au/about/bikram-postures-benefits/awkward-pose-utkatasana/">ones</a> <a href="http://bikramhartford.com/bikram-yoga/postures-and-benefits/">too</a>. I like the little characters in the latter one). My analysis will determine in what order and how many times each part of the body is being worked. I think that while personal experience, anecdotal evidence and popular press articles have brought people to the mat, many practioners are eager to know what&#39;s actually happening to their bodies during the poses, and there&#39;s been no quantitative analysis done. My project would clarify the haze between posture and benefit to demystify those who already practice or who are thinking of starting. <br>
<br>
There are a number of health and fitness sites I could pitch this to including: <a href= "http://www.womenshealthmag.com/">Women&#39;s Health</a>, <a href= "http://greatist.com/">Greatist.com</a>, <a href= "http://www.shape.com/">Shape</a>, <a href= "http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/">Fitness</a>, <a href= "https://yoga.com/">. Yoga.com</a> or the <a href= "http://www.yogajournal.com/">Yoga Journal</a> might even want it. <br>
<br>
I would need to learn how to scrape all of these sites for the posture information as well as hone some skills in interactive graphic making for this project. I have big ambitions but have outlined what I&#39;d like to accomplish in baby steps so that I have at least something I&#39;m proud of when the deadline hits. <br>
<br>
The goals:<br>
<br>
Baby step<br>
Create a histogram plotting body part vs. times worked to see if (and how many times) each is used throughout a Bikram sequence. Are some not worked at all? Which ones are worked a lot? It&#39;d also be great to have each block on the chart be a graphic of the posture to see exactly which posture is working the back, thighs, etc. Are there some poses that give you the most bang for your buck? <br>
<br>
Next level<br>
Make the histogram chart above appear in time to the actual 26 posture sequence. I&#39;d like to be able to play through (or maybe have each posture show up in a list) and then a little graphic of it moving into the chart so the chart is actually created as the sequence progresses, just like it happens in a real Bikram class. When certain muscles are worked, when in time are these changes are happening? <br>
<br>
Super Next level<br>
Have a silhouette of a person who starts off all blue. As the sequence is played, different parts of the body begin to change color (get red to display heat and work) to display what&#39;s working, when, and how much it&#39;s being worked. I could perhaps use the graphics on <a href= "https://yoga.com/poses">this website</a> to help me out. <br>
<br>

To Note: Along with body parts that are worked, each pose also claims health/therapeutic benefits. I could easily get this data and use it to generate a chart like the one described in the baby step section and likely next level section as well, not sure about Super Next Level. <br>
<br>

<h2>Pitch 2: Personal posture generator</h2> 
As an alternative idea I could use the same data sources from pitch 1 to create a posture generator for body parts and health benefit inputs. Most websites either list the postures and the associated benefits or list individual muscle groups and individual health benefits, requiring you to dig around and figure out the postures (or maybe there&#39;s just one!) that can give you what you need. <br>
<br>
My project would instead allow you to be the master, inputting what you&#39;re looking to gain and then generating the least amount of postures necessary for you to achieve your goals. Think of it almost like a site like <a href="http://www.recipekey.com/">this</a>, where you input what ingredients you have in your kitchen and the website lists all the things you can make with it. This project would effectively do the same thing; you could make your own yoga meal! (aka get a list of postures) <br>
<br>
All yoga postures would be included in the database, not just Bikram. The project would be devoid of the sequence element described in pitch 1 but would require me to do more analysis on the data to account for overlaps in muscle groups worked and health benefits as well as learn how to create an interactive input/output system. Generating the end goal of this project could perhaps be a bit more feasible as well as practical for the millions of yoga practioners. <br>
<br>
It could be pitched to the same outlets and also some complementary alternative medicine sites eager to promote yoga as a legitimate way to receive health benefits.
